  # Project: Predict Vehicle Prices using Vehicle Dataset 
Objective
Build a system that can predict the prices for vehicles using data on Vehicle specifications, make, etc. Explore the data to understand the features and figure out an approach. 
üöó Step 1: Data Collection & Exploration
‚Ä¢	Use datasets containing vehicle specifications like make, model, year, mileage, fuel type, engine size, transmission, and condition.
‚Ä¢	If you're using a dataset from Kaggle or other sources, load it with Pandas for initial exploration.
‚Ä¢	Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Seaborn and Matplotlib to visualize correlations (e.g., impact of mileage or model year on price).
‚Ä¢	Identify missing values and outliers (e.g., extreme mileage or unrealistic pricing).
üèó Step 2: Feature Engineering & Preprocessing
‚Ä¢	Scaling & Normalization: Standardize numerical features using MinMaxScaler or StandardScaler.
‚Ä¢	Encoding categorical features: Use One-Hot Encoding for categorical variables like vehicle make and transmission.
‚Ä¢	Feature extraction: Compute vehicle age (current year - model year), fuel efficiency, or repair history as additional factors.

üîç Step 3: Choosing a Machine Learning Model
Since predicting prices is a regression problem, consider:
‚Ä¢	Linear Regression (good baseline model)
‚Ä¢	Random Forest Regressor (handles non-linearity)
‚Ä¢	Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost) (powerful for structured data)
‚Ä¢	Neural Networks (MLPRegressor) (for deep learning-based modeling)
üìè Step 4: Model Training & Optimization
‚Ä¢	Split the data into training and test sets using a train-test split.
‚Ä¢	Evaluate using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.
‚Ä¢	Tune hyperparameters using GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV.
üöÄ Step 5: Deployment Strategy
‚Ä¢	Convert the trained model into an API using Flask or FastAPI.
‚Ä¢	Deploy on GitHub for scalability.
